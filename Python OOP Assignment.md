## Python OOP Assignment
Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?
> Python OOP concept helps us to solve complex problems by using objects(Similar to real world)  
> OOP has other advantages like Encapsulation, Ploymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, etc.  

Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?
> In an inheritance the attribute is first serached in the class the object was created. Later it will search in the upper super classes.

Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?
> Instance object is always associated with self keyword & it is bound yo a particular object.  
> Class object is bound to a class & hence self keyword is not used.  

Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?
> In a class the first argument is self keyword. It is nothing but a refernce to the object who called that method.

Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?
> \__init\__() method in a class is a constructor of that calss.  
> It gets called as soon as an object is created.  

Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?
> Class instance can be created anywhere in the body of class.  
> We can declare & define it similar to any other variable declartion without the self keyword.  

Q7. What is the process for creating a class?
> Class is created using the *class* keyword.
```
# Creating blank class
class Data():
	pass
	
# Creating a class with a constructor
class Data()
	def __init__(self):
		print("Welcome to the Data class")
```

Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?
> The super classes of the class are the parent class from which the sub-class was created.  
> The charecteristics of super class are inherited in sub-class.  

Q9. What is the relationship between classes and modules?
> Classes in Python are the collection of attributes & methods. These can be used only by the objects of the class or the derived class.  
> Modules in Python are a way to organize code. It can consists of sunctions, classes, methods, etc. We can import the module and use it wherever required.  

Q10. How do you make instances and classes?
> Class is created using the *class* keyword & we can define the class attributes & methods inside it.  
> To create instances of a Class we need to create the class objects by passing the arguments if required.  
```
# Creating a class
class Employee():
	company_name = "Google"

	def __init__(self, name, country):
		self.name = name
		self.country = country

	def display(self):
		print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am from {self.country}, working at {Employee.company_name}")
		
# Creating instance/object
emp_1 = Employee('Vivek', 'India')
emp_1.display()
```

Q11. Where and how should be class attributes created?
> Class attributes should be created directly inside the body of Class.  
> We can aslo declafe a class attribute outside the class using Class name as prefix.
```
class Example():
	# Class attribute
	count = 5
	def __init__(self):
		pass
print(Example.count) # Output -> 5
# Class attribute declared outside of the class
Example.type = 'Outside'
print(Example.type)
```

Q12. Where and how are instance attributes created?
> Instance attributes are mostly created inside the constructor. It can also be created in a method.
> Note that self keyword is required to create the instance attribute.
> We can also create the instance attributes outside the class using the object name as prefix.
```
class Person():
	
    def __init__(self, name):
        # Instance attribute declared inside the class
        self.name = name

    def disp(self):
        print("Name:", self.name, "& Age:", self.age)

e1 = Person('abc')
e2 = Person('xyz')

# Instance attributes declared outside of the class
e1.age = 20
e2.age = 30

e1.disp() # Outout -> Name: abc & Age: 20
e2.disp() # Output -> Name: xyz & Age: 30
```

Q14. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?

Q15. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?

Q16. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?

Q17. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?

Q18. Describe three applications for exception processing.

Q19. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?

Q20. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?

Q21. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.

Q22. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of  
whether or not an exception exists.

Q23. What is the purpose of the try statement?

Q24. What are the two most popular try statement variations?

Q25. What is the purpose of the raise statement?

Q26. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?

Q28. What are *args, **kwargs?

Q29. How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?

Q30. What are Lambda Functions?

Q31. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?

Q32. Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of 
class C, which version gets invoked?

Q33. Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?

Q34.Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.

Q35. What is the global keyword?
